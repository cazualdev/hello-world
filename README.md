# hello-world

Hello to all that may be viewing this!

My name is Seth, and this is my GitHub page!

I am excited to see what projects I will be creating for GitHub personally and professionally.
My current languages are Python and C#, which is what I am primarily using at school and work, and hope to use them in my  
first projects here on Github.

Recently I have learned React.js and I am looking forward to work on side projects with that framework as well.
